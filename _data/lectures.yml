#
# - date: Date of the lecture
#   topic: Title of the lecture
#   description: Longer description of lecture content
#   slides: url to the lecture slide
#   video: url for lecture video

# d1 = datetime.date(2017,8,24)
# d2 = datetime.date(2017,12,14)
# days = pd.date_range(d1,d2)
#
# for d in days[(days.dayofweek == 1) | (days.dayofweek == 3)]:
#     print(str(d.month) + "/" + str(d.day) + "/" + str(d.year))
